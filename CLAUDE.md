# Repo Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to version control and work on a single and very detailed slash command for organising filesystems. 

The slash command should be versatile enough to work across a wide variety of systems and deterministic enough that it sorts based upon clearly defined logic obviating the need for frequent user input or any at all. 

# Latest Version

prompt.md

# Updating Workflow

Before any guided updated:

- copy prompt.md to archive and give it the latest iterative version number
- create the improved version as prompt.md 
- add or apend a markdown badge (shields.io) with the new version number
  
## Rules

Always iterate by creating new versions. Never overwrite.
